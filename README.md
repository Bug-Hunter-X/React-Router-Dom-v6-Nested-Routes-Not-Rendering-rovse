# React Router Dom v6 Nested Routes Not Rendering

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with nested routes in React Router v6. The problem is that nested routes, despite appearing to be correctly configured, fail to render their components.  The parent route renders, but child routes remain blank. This is usually due to a misconfiguration of the route structure or incorrect usage of the `Routes` and `Route` components.

## Bug Report

The main issue lies in the provided code snippet in `bug.js`. This code correctly sets up the routes, but the nested components do not render as expected.

## Solution

The solution, detailed in `bugSolution.js`, addresses the problem by ensuring the correct structure and usage of the `Routes` component within the nested route.  Incorrect nesting or incorrect nesting of routes can lead to problems. This fix involves reviewing the routes configuration and ensuring that every component has its path correctly defined.
